# Predictive-Modeling-with-NFL-Combine-Data
In this project we use NFL combine data to make predictions determining 1) whether a player is drafted or not and 2) if a player is drafted, what pick they are drafted with.

Data is stored in the data folder and can be used directly with the two modeling notebooks: 1 for classification and 1 for regression. The final pdf report is stored in combine.pdf.
